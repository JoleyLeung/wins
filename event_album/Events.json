With the ubiquitous availability of location enabled mobile devices and wireless communication, the time is ripe for a big data driven, dynamic, and smarter urban transportation system. In such a system, vehicles, users, and infrastructures interact with each other and are informed in real-time. They collaborate to avoid Matthew Effect; form seamless traffic flow; allow alternative and convenient means of transportation; and enable realtime ridesharing. In this talk, we present our efforts towards realizing such a system.  Specifically, we describe our efforts in analyzing taxicab datasets to reduce cruising and live mileage ratio of taxicabs, identifying alternative transport models, and building a large scale real-time ridesharing system."

        "eventdescription": "Most healthcare systems can be characterized as dynamic and complex service systems, in which there are often significant interactions and interdependencies between constantly evolving subsystems. Despite this, decisions for the operation of health systems often rely on static decision making policies. An overview of research examining new models for improving dynamic resource allocation in complex systems, including hospital and public health response applications will be presented. These models utilize discrete and stochastic optimization methods in the development of new algorithms for resource allocation. Similar to healthcare systems, the decisions for initiating research collaborations or making career decisions are made in a dynamic and complex environment. The talk will be concluded with a discussion of the career lessons Jackie has learned during the process of and after completing her PhD."
