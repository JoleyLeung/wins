Despite this, decisions for the operation of health systems often rely on static decision making policies. An overview of research examining new models for improving dynamic resource allocation in complex systems, including hospital and public health response applications will be presented. These models utilize discrete and stochastic optimization methods in the development of new algorithms for resource allocation. Similar to healthcare systems, the decisions for initiating research collaborations or making career decisions are made in a dynamic and complex environment. The talk will be concluded with a discussion of the career lessons Jackie has learned during the process of and after completing her PhD.",

Potential applications of WBANs such as infant monitoring and epidemic predictions will be presented.",

        "eventdescription": "The goal of the talk will be to explain most words in the following abstract: A Lagrangian correspondence is a Lagrangian submanifold in the product of two symplectic manifolds. This generalizes the notion of a symplectomorphism and was introduced by Weinstein in an attempt to build a symplectic category that has morphisms between any pair of symplectic manifolds (not just symplectomorphic pairs). In joint work with Chris Woodward we define such a cateory, in which all (generalized) Lagrangian correspondences are composable morphisms. We extend it to a 2-category by extending Floer homology to generalized Lagrangian correspondences. This is based on counts of ‚Äôholomorphic quilts‚Äô - a collection of holomorphic curves in different manifolds with ‚Äôseam values‚Äô in the Lagrangian correspondences. A fundamental isomorphism of Floer homologies ensures that our constructions are compatible with the geometric composition of Lagrangian correspondences. This provides a general prescription for constructing topological invariants. We consider e.g. 3-manifolds or links as morphisms (cobordisms or tangles) in a topological category. In order to obtain a topological invariant from our generalized Floer homology, it suffices to - decompose morphisms into simple morphisms (e.g. by cutting between critical levels of a Morse function) - associate to the objects and simple morphisms smooth symplectic manifolds and Lagrangian correspondences between them (e.g. using moduli spaces of bundles or representations) - check that the moves between different decompositions are associated to (good) geometric composition of Lagrangian correspondences.",
